<p align="justify">I am a seasoned Cross-Platform Developer, boasting six years of hands-on coding experience.</p>

<p align="justify">My journey began back in 2017 when I delved into Kotlin, initially crafting simple mobile applications and progressively honing my skills. As time went on, around 2018, I delved into the realm of server-side applications using JavaScript, and I adeptly handled databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL. Concurrently, I diligently studied clean architecture patterns and embraced its principles to enhance my development prowess.</p>

<p align="justify">In my pursuit of knowledge, I stumbled upon Go, a statically typed server-side language, captivated by its potential, I dedicated myself to learning its fundamentals. Around 2019, I explored Dart language and its associated framework called Flutter. With Flutter's power, I mastered the art of building natively compiled, multi-platform applications, all from a single, efficient codebase.</p>

<p align="justify">Throughout my coding journey, my driving motivation has always been to create solutions that empower and aid others in their daily lives. There is immense satisfaction in knowing that something I build can make someone's life easier and more enjoyable.</p>

<p align="justify">Over the years, my expertise has flourished, and I now possess a profound fluency in utilizing Go and JavaScript for server-side development, while skillfully navigating the Flutter framework and all its native languages for client-side development and compilation processes.</p>
