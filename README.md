<p align="justify"> I am a Cross-Platform Developer with 6 years of coding experience. </p>
<p align="justify"> I started in 2017 with Kotlin, making simple mobile applications and expanding my knowledge over time. Around 2018, I started to learn how to create server-side applications with JavaScript and work with databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL. During this time I also began to learn clean architecture patterns and its principles. Later, I found the statically typed server-side language Go and started learning it basics. Around 2019, I started to learn Dart lang and its framework named flutter for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase. </p>
<p align="justify"> My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier. </p>
<p align="justify"> Over the last few years, my knowledge and experience with development have expanded. I am fluent in using Go / JavaScript for server-side development and Flutter for client-side development as well as all native languages used by Flutter framework for compilation. </p>
