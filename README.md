### 𝙰𝚋𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝙼𝚎

I am a Cross-Platform Developer with 6 years of coding experience.

I started in 2017 with Kotlin, making simple mobile applications and expanding my knowledge over time. Around 2018, I started to learn how to create server-side applications with JavaScript and work with databases like SQLite and PostgreSQL. During this time I also began to learn clean architecture patterns and its principles. Later, I found the statically typed server-side language Go and started learning it basics. Around 2019, I started to learn Dart lang and its framework named flutter for building natively compiled, multi-platform applications from a single codebase.

My goal with coding is to help others. I enjoy being able to create something that other people can use to make their lives easier.

Over the last few years, my knowledge and experience with development have expanded. I am fluent in using Go / JavaScript for server-side development and Flutter for client-side development as well as all native languages used by Flutter framework for compilation.

Most recently I've been trying to get better at bash scripting, so I'm trying to find simple projects written in other languages that I can port to bash. My asciibots-bash project is one example of this, and in the future I hope to find more projects like it that I can port to bash.
